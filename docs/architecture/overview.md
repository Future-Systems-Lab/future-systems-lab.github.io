# Architecture Overview — Future Systems Lab

Future Systems Lab uses a layered digital health architecture that unifies:

- Consent governance  
- Secure identity models (DID/VC + RBAC)  
- Multimodal session pipelines (HypnoNeuro L1–L3)  
- Wearable physiological sensing  
- Orthomolecular analytics and inference  
- Data-layer and BI pipelines  

This documentation site serves as a high-level public overview.  
Detailed subsystem diagrams and private implementation details remain in secured internal repositories.
